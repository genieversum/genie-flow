# Genie Flow
The Genie Flow Framework is intended to make it easy to design and implement dialogues between a
Human user and an LLM. Such dialogue is typically directed through a number of stages. Often they
start with a preamble, then some information retrieval, some conclusion building and an epilogue.

Keeping that state in check: what prompt should be used, given what has been discussed so far, is
not trivial. And when implemented using simple if / then / else logic, the code becomes hard to 
maintain.https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2024/05/08/patch-release-gitlab-16-11-2-released/

This package aims to simplify and streamline the creation of dialogue flows that have a user
interact with an LLM.
